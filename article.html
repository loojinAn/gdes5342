			<p class="text">We were supposed to have stopped playing hours ago.
				My brother and I had been locked in combat with a single enemy in the “run and gun” game <span class="mark">Cuphead</span>,
				dying every two minutes and feverishly restarting.
				Our concentration was absolute. We hardly spoke.
				Our foe: a unicycling blimp resembling Betty Boop.
				When we finally prevailed, there was just time for a euphoric high-five before it was on to the next: a pair of quarrelsome boxing frogs.
			</p>

			<p class="text"><span class="mark">Cuphead</span>’s charming characters belie a ruthlessly hard game.
				While books and films can be demanding, games are the only narrative form that consists principally of putting obstacles in the path of progress,
				making the player prove they’re “good enough” to get the whole story.
				Since gamers expect a challenge, a key question for designers is: what is the right amount of difficulty, and why?
			</p>

			<p class="text">The rote memorisation of enemy attack patterns in <span class="mark">Cuphead</span> harks back to the heyday of games arcades.
				In those days, difficulty was a purely economic concern: games had to be tough enough that players would lose frequently and pay to continue.
				When consoles came into the home, developers added difficulty settings to appeal to a variety of players, offering “easy”, “medium” or “hard” modes.

			<p class="text">Mainstream games gradually got easier too, adding checkpoints and assisted aiming and steering, prioritising narrative and spectacle over challenge.
				Then a converse current began: a growing market for incredibly difficult games that offer purists a “hardcore experience”.
			</p>

			<p class="text">The balance is in making a game challenging but not punishing.
				Too hard, and players will feel frustrated. Too easy and they’ll get bored.
				Developers must guide players through an obstacle course but make them feel they’re succeeding because of their own skill and ingenuity.
				When increasing difficulty, they might simply make enemies stronger or heroes weaker, but this is considered a cheap fix.
			</p>

			<p class="text">Game studio FromSoftware has become a byword for excellence in the design of difficult games.
				Its violent titles are set in brooding gothic environments, telling elliptical tales of human decay.
				Banner series <span class="mark">Dark Souls</span> is so beloved that it has developed a cult following and spawned a whole sub-genre, the “souls-like” game.
			</p>

			<p class="text">Noted game theorist Jesper Juul wrote that “failure is central to player enjoyment of games”.
				The important question for a developer is how players fail.
				In <span class="mark">Dark Souls</span> you die a lot, but each battle is meticulously designed so that death becomes a learning exercise and combat a puzzle, solved by training your reflexes and observation.
				A bond of trust is created between the designer and the player: though the game is hard, players believe they will improve with each attempt and ultimately triumph.
				FromSoftware is so confident in the design that it does not include an easy mode.

			<p class="text">This inflexibility sparked controversy last year.
				When FromSoftware released the samurai title <span class="mark">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</span>, some asked: would its steep difficulty curve exclude less experienced gamers?
				Was this an issue of accessibility? The generation gap between players is widening, and some older gamers no longer have dozens of free hours to master a boss fight.
				They want to feel they’re making progress in the odd hours squeezed between work and family duties.
				What’s the harm in adding an easy mode?
			</p>

			<p class="text">Opponents saw this as a threat to the purity of the medium.
				If the goal in a game like <span class="mark">Sekiro</span> is to strategise through nail-biting battles and earn the rush of victory, lowering the stakes would both neuter the experience and impose artistic restraints on the developer.
				The purists argued that a game designed for everybody is in fact designed for nobody.
			</p>

			<p class="text">There is room for nuance here, even if the internet rarely encourages it.
				Some games allow you to make granular tweaks to difficulty or offer “narrative mode” for players who just want the story.
				In offering options, they accept that people have varying motivations for play: there are gamers who want a gentle ride, others to test their reflexes, while some — the kind who use “one hundred per cent” as a verb — want to ferret out every secret.
				Games are distinguished by their ability to offer the player choices.
				If you’ve built a garden of forking paths, why limit visitors to just one?
